# CRDT

Comprehensive collection of data types for eventually consistent systems.

## Installation

In your `build.sbt` add

```scala
resolvers += "Machinomy" at "http://artifactory.machinomy.com/artifactory/release"

libraryDependencies += "com.machinomy" %% "crdt" % "0.0.2"
```

or 

```scala
resolvers += "Machinomy" at "http://artifactory.machinomy.com/artifactory/snapshot"

libraryDependencies += "com.machinomy" %% "crdt" % "0.0.3-SNAPSHOT"
```

## Usage

Eventually consistent system comprises of machines, that work together. They have to maintain a shared global state.
CAP theorem [[GILBERT2002](#GILBERT2002)] limits properties of the state could be supported. Some applications permit to loosen Consistency
in favour of Availability and Partitioning. This leads to eventually consistent systems.

Conflict-free Replicated Data Type is a data structure designed to support eventual consistency [[SHAPIRO2011](#SHAPIRO2011)]. A machine that belongs to the system maintains a local replica of the global state.
Properties of CRDT guarantee the replicas converge to a common state. That makes the data structure
support simultaneous operations sustainable to network disturbancy.

CRDTs could be of two types:

- operation-based, or op-based for short,
- state-based.

The types can be emulated on top of each other. The difference is in payload the replicas send to each other.
As the name implies, it is an operation, like `add` or `remove`, or full state.

### State-based CRDT

State-based CRDT is a data structure that supports operation `merge`, or `join` for replicas so that:

* `a merge (b merge c) == (a merge b) merge c`,
* `a merge b == b merge a`,
* `a merge a == a`.

Data structure like this is a join-semilattice. We could derive a partial order on the replicas. We could say if `a â‰¤ b`. This effectively means state-based CRDTs converge to some value, the least upper bound. It gives another name then: Con<b>v</b>ergent Replicated Data Type, or C<b>v</b>RDT.

![State-based CRDT Flow](doc/images/state_based_crdt_flow.png)

`merge` operation resolves any conflicts that happen between the replicas by following a formal rule. The rule differs among the types. A developer is responsible for choosing the right data structure for her need.

#### G-Counter

Short for grow-only counter. It could be incremented only. The merge takes the maximum count for each replica. Value is the sum of all replicas.

Say, replica id is `Int`, and GCounter manages `Int` replica counters as well:

```scala
import com.machinomy.crdt.state._
import cats.syntax.all._
import cats._

val counter = Monoid[GCounter[Int, Int]].empty // empty G-Counter
val firstReplica = counter + (1 -> 1) // increment replica 1
val secondReplica = counter + (2 -> 2) // increment replica 2
val firstReplicaMerged = firstReplica |+| secondReplica // merge
val secondReplicaMerged = secondReplica |+| firstReplica // merge

firstReplicaMerged == secondReplicaMerged // the result is independent of merge order
```

#### PN-Counter

TODO

#### G-Set

Short for grow-only set. Supports only addition of an element. `merge` operation is essentially a set union,
which is commutative and convergent.

```scala
import com.machinomy.crdt.state._
import cats.syntax.all._
import cats._

val counter = Monoid[GSet[Int]].empty // empty G-Set
val firstReplica = counter + 1 // add element
val secondReplica = counter + 2 // add element
val firstReplicaMerged = firstReplica |+| secondReplica // merge
val secondReplicaMerged = secondReplica |+| firstReplica // merge

firstReplicaMerged == secondReplicaMerged // the result is independent of merge order
```
